        "description": "We’dneverrrrencourage swiping those small shampoo bottles you find in the showers in your hotel room, but we will say if you were planning on using them to restock your own bathroom toiletries you’re unfortunately out of luck–that’s because as of January 1, 2025 New York State officiallybanned single-use toiletry bottles under 12 ounces. The bill, which was first introduced in 2019, is part of an effort to cut down on single-use plastic. According to The Department of Environmental Conservation, the toiletry bottles arebanned from hotels with more than 50 rooms,though by 2026 all New York hotels will have to comply. First-time offenders that don’t comply with the bill will receive a warning with 30 days to “correct the violation. ” However, if they don’t correct the violation, they’ll have to pay a$250 fine.",

Now, however, the MTA says they’re instead looking torun the train along an existing line underneath All Faiths Cemeteryin Queens’ Middle Village neighborhood. MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber stated how the subterranean route beneath the cemetery is underutilized and is currently only used by a freight train once per day. The new proposal would instead turn it “into something which is transformative for so many New Yorkers” and cut the trip between Bay Ridge and Jackson Heights by five minutes compared to if the tram had to share right-of-way with vehicular traffic.",

But with the help of eye witnesses and the American Meteor Society, they’ve been able to come to an understanding. NASA originally estimated “that the fireball was first sighted at an altitude of 49 miles above Upper Bay (east of Greenville Yard). ” From there, they believed the meteor passed over the Statue of Liberty after moving a little east of North and descending at 18 degrees from vertical, where it finally disintegrated 29 miles aboveMidtown, Manhattan.",

The consortium will aid local leading institutions in their quest for research and development, job generation, and AI opportunity discovery. Since computing resources that power AI systems are known to be quite expensive and primarily handled by large tech companies, Empire AI will mediate the gap between said large companies and individual researchers, public interest organizations, and small companies. Moreover, Empire AI will expedite AI development with the public interest of New York State in mind. Columbia, Cornell University, New York University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the State University of New York (SUNY), the City University of New York (CUNY), and the Simons Foundation will make up the seven founding institutions of Empire AI.",

Of course the story has been denied by the city, but we all know how entertaining old legends can be.

A team of researchers from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory studied upward and downward vertical land motion across NYC for 5+ years. Through interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), they found that theareas of NYC that were sinking at various rates had previously been modified, whether that be from land reclamation or the construction of landfills. Thus, making the surface looser and more susceptible to compress under buildings. “We’ve produced such a detailed map of vertical land motion in the New York City area that there are features popping out that haven’t been noticed before,” said lead author Brett Buzzanga, a postdoctoral researcher at JPL.",

The news comes shortly after Beyoncé’s Renaissance tour and Taylor Swift’s Eras tour sawaverage resale ticket prices reaching heights of $900 and $1,095respectively, either breaking the bank for fans or unfortunately leaving them ticketless. Regardless of whether or not they made a profit, sellers who have made $600 or more over the course of a yearwill be sent a 1099-K form to complete, though they’ll only be charged additional taxes if they earned a profit by selling tickets at higher amounts than they paid themselves.",

The previous rulings surrounding scaffolding actually incentivized property owners to leave them up—hence why facade repairs often take extended periods of time to complete. Get Sheds Down intends to target longstanding scaffolding sites and business districts while “[flipping] the script” and encouraging property owners to quicken repairs and take down sheds with expired permits with the threat offinancial penalties and fees.",

The modern map we’ve been using for the past 40 years is apparently not very geographically accurate, so the transit authority has been exploring ways to better communicate how the system actually works for users. The new map shows how the subway tracks connect and interact with each other in a clearer way– for instance, in the current design, different lines are combined into one at points when they run together, but the new design actually shows them all separated, just running parallel to one another. The new design is quite similar to a subway map design from the ’70s, by Massimo Vignelli, which was only used for a few year before it was scrapped by the department. Overall, it is simpler and cleaner, but apparently at the time they felt it took “too many liberties with geography.",
